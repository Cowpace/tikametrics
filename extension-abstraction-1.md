### Task - Abstraction 1
In the CSV-manipulation task, we filtered by date and aggregated using a sum. 

We would like to be able to filter by different criteria and aggregate using other functions. 

Refactor the code from the original task to be agnostic about the filtering criteria and aggregation function, providing an API by which a client could give us those pieces.
